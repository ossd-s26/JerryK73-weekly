title: "Week 3: Browser Extension Project
---

## Team Green Progress

Team green is off to a great start, we decided on an idea for our browser extension and created a repository for the project. Our current idea is to make an extension that allows you to change the color of your tabs. If all goes well, I think it would also be cool to explore if we can add more color options for tab groups. We have not run into any major problems yet, although we will probably run into some when we start implementing our ideas. My biggest contributions so far were creating the repository, README, and CONTRIBUTING files, although I have yet to add much content to them. I started on the general structure of the README file, but would like to discuss with the group more to have a more robust idea of how we want to execute this. Overall I am excited to see what our group ends up creating and to see how our first project turns out.
